"summary_en": "Finbold warns traders about two major token unlocks this week that could add selling pressure: Solana (SOL) will unlock 502,930 SOL (~$121.22M, 0.09% of circulating supply), and Official Trump (TRUMP) will unlock 4.89M TRUMP ($58.82M, ~1.52% of circulating supply). The piece notes that unlocks often weigh on near-term prices, with impact varying by market conditions. It cites spot prices at press time (SOL ~$236; TRUMP ~$8.57) but stresses broader sentiment also matters.",
"summary_zh": "Finbold 提醒本周有两项大额代币解锁，或对价格形成抛压：Solana（SOL）将解锁 502,930 枚 SOL（约 1.2122 亿美元，约占流通量 0.09%）；Official Trump（TRUMP）将解锁 489 万枚 TRUMP（约 5,882 万美元，约占流通量 1.52%）。文章强调，代币解锁常在短期内压制价格，其影响还取决于当时的整体市场情绪，并给出发稿时的现价（SOL 约 236 美元；TRUMP 约 8.57 美元）。",
